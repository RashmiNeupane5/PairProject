## Introduction  
The analysis is done for partial fulfillment of Evidence-Based Business Analytics course offered for students enrolled in Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at [**Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM)**](https://som.ku.edu.np/). For the analysis, a dataset named [*Big mart Sales Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mragpavank/big-mart-sales-dataset) was selected from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of multiple columns with more than 5000 rows. Initally we studied the data and took decision on which columns to include and which to exclude. After the decision was made the data was cleaned and we obtained the[desired dataset](https://github.com/RashmiNeupane5/PairProject/blob/main/train.csv). While cleaning, undesired columns along with any rows containing null values were excluded.  After the data was cleaned, [visualization](https://github.com/RashmiNeupane5/PairProject/blob/main/big-mart-visualization.pbix  ) were created, through which insights could be drawn. Through the visualization, insights  regarding total number of items and tier were identified. Further we divided the data through year of establishment and sales by location type through tier through the use of visualizations. Lastly, we have listed the major findings of the analysis which is beneficial for big mart to see which outlet has the highest sales and which item from basic and non basic goods have highest sales showing the outlet size and location.

## Analysis  
A Super market requires different outlet location type with different items so we showed the data of different tiers with total number of items in each tier and as a whole.
