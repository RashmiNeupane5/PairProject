## Introduction  
The analysis is done for partial fulfillment of Evidence-Based Business Analytics course offered for students enrolled in Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) at [**Kathmandu University School of Management (KUSOM)**](https://som.ku.edu.np/). For the analysis, a dataset named [*Big mart Sales Dataset*](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mragpavank/big-mart-sales-dataset) was selected from Kaggle. The dataset consisted of multiple columns with more than 5000 rows. Initally we studied the data and took decision on which columns to include and which to exclude. After the decision was made the data was cleaned and we obtained the[desired dataset](https://github.com/RashmiNeupane5/PairProject/blob/main/train.csv). While cleaning, undesired columns along with any rows containing null values were excluded.  After the data was cleaned, [visualization](https://github.com/RashmiNeupane5/PairProject/blob/main/big-mart-visualization.pbix  ) were created, through which insights could be drawn. Through the visualization, insights  regarding total number of items and tier were identified. Further we divided the data through year of establishment and sales by location type through tier through the use of visualizations. Lastly, we have listed the major findings of the analysis which is beneficial for big mart to see which outlet has the highest sales and which item from basic and non basic goods have highest sales showing the outlet size and location.

## Analysis  
A Super market requires different outlet location type with different items so we showed the data of different tiers with total number of items in each tier and as a whole.

The total number of outlets contains a total of  8523 items with 2388 items on Tier 1, 2785 items on Tier 2 and 3350 items on Tier 3.

Analyzing grocery store sales data from 1985 to 2002 reveals a boom in overall sales, with fresh produce leading the pack. Fruits and Vegetables reign supreme from 2000 onwards, followed by Meat and Dairy. Interestingly, the number of stores boomed until 1997 before dipping slightly in the later years. This intriguing data suggests a shift in consumer habits, with a growing taste for healthy options, alongside a possible market saturation by the late 90s.

)   
The data shows that basic items, such as dairy, fruits and vegetables, and household goods, sell significantly more than non-basic items, such as soft drinks, canned foods, and frozen foods. Basic items account for 82.3% of total sales, while non-basic items account for only 17.7%.  

![visualization_page-0006](https://github.com/RashmiNeupane5/PairProject/assets/159395813/d1de9dcf-7591-4e47-a245-d702d1a6f01d )  

The top selling categories are Fruits and Vegetables, followed by Dairy and then Canned Foods.Frozen Fruits appears to be the most expensive category, followed by Meat and then Soft Drinks. However, it is important to note that this could be because it is sold by weight and not by unit, making direct price comparisons difficult.

It appears that medium-sized outlets generate the most sales, followed by small outlets and then large outlets.  

## Findings  

The major findings from the analysis are as follows:
* Tier 3 has been having the highest sales by location from 1985 - 2009
*The data suggests a growing customer preference for fresh produce. Fruits and Vegetables lead in sales, followed by Meat and Dairy. This indicates a potential health-conscious trend.
* The analysis shows a boom in store numbers until 1997, followed by a slight dip. This suggests a potential market saturation in certain areas by the late 90s. 
*Basic items like dairy, fruits & vegetables, and household goods dominate sales (82.3%) compared to non-essentials (17.7%). This highlights the focus on essential purchases.
* Interestingly, medium-sized outlets appear to generate the most sales, followed by small and large outlets. This might be due to factors like product variety or location convenience.
